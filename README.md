This is simply a repo to hold the various files (mainly dotfiles) I use to configure command shells.
There's some evolution involved as I started with csh, later moved to ksh, still later to bash, and am
currently using zsh (by way of oh-my-zsh).

Note that I don't use these files directly. Instead, I clone this repo in my .config directory, and create symlinks to
the files as appropriate (e.g. <code>symlink .config/shell-config/kshrc.ksh .kshrc</code>).
